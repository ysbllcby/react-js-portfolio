            I am a results-driven professional with a diverse background in
            software development and over 7 years of dedicated customer service
            experience in the hospitality sector. Finished a Diploma in
            Information Technology with a focus on Software Development at SAIT,
            I maintain a 3.98 GPA. My technical expertise spans HTML, CSS, Java,
            C#, JavaScript, MySQL, MongoDB, and various design tools such as
            Figma and Adobe XD. I am well-versed in content management systems
            like WordPress and have hands-on experience with development tools
            like Git, Visual Studio, Azure, and Jira.
            <br />
            <br />
            In my recent role as Social Media/Web Support at The Wild Bird
            Store, I spearheaded strategic collaborations aligning social media
            and web strategies with business goals. My responsibilities included
            dynamic content creation, web design and optimization using
            WordPress, and data-driven decision-making. In a collaborative SAIT
            Capstone Project, I played a key role in designing and deploying a
            Point-Of-Sales System, showcasing proficiency in Figma, Visual
            Studio 2022, MySQL Workbench, C# .NET, and Typescript.

            My volunteer work at SAIT involved assisting speakers during
            breakouts and managing the registration booth. Additionally, my
            background in the food and beverage industry includes roles such as
            Baker and Supervisor at Tim Hortons, and managerial positions at
            Classic Savory and Pancake House in the Philippines. In these roles,
            I achieved notable successes in reducing food waste, maintaining
            high audit scores, and consistently meeting sales targets.
